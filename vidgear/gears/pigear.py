class PiGear:

	"""
	PiGear is similar to CamGear but exclusively made to support various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules 
	(such as OmniVision OV5647 Camera Module and Sony IMX219 Camera Module). To interface with these 
	modules correctly, PiGear provides a flexible multi-threaded wrapper around complete picamera 
	python library and provides us the ability to exploit its various features like brightness, saturation, sensor_mode, etc. effortlessly.
	
	:param (tuple) resolution: sets the resolution (width,height). Its default value is (640,480).

	:param (integer) framerate: sets the framerate. Its default value is 25.

	:param (string) colorspace: set colorspace of the video stream. Its default value is None.

	:param (dict) **options: sets parameter supported by PiCamera Class to the input video stream. 
							/ These attribute provides the flexibility to manipulate input raspicam video stream directly. 
							/ Parameters can be passed using this **option, allows you to pass key worded variable length of arguments to PiGear Class.

	:param (boolean) logging: set this flag to enable/disable error logging essential for debugging. Its default value is False.

	:param (integer) time_delay: sets time delay(in seconds) before start reading the frames. 
					/ This delay is essentially required for camera to warm-up. 
					/ Its default value is 0.
